It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *

create press interactions by analyzing the\n * geometry of elements and observing when another responder (e.g. ScrollView)\n * has stolen the touch lock. It offers hooks for your component to provide\n * interaction feedback to the user:\n *\n * - When a press has activated (e.g. highlight an element)\n * - When a press has deactivated (e.g. un-highlight an element)\n * - When a press sould trigger an action, meaning it activated and deactivated\n *   while within the geometry of the element without the lock being stolen.\n *\n * A high quality interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should\n * be a slight delay before activation. Moving your finger beyond an element's\n * bounds should trigger deactivation, but moving the same finger back within an\n * element's bounds should trigger reactivation.\n *\n * In order to use `Pressability`, do the following:\n *\n * 1. Instantiate `Pressability` and store it on your component's state.\n *\n *    state = {\n *      pressability: new Pressability({\n *        // ...\n *      }),\n *    };\n *\n * 2. Choose the rendered component who should collect the press events. On that\n *    element, spread `pressability.getEventHandlers()` into its props.\n *\n *    return (\n *      <View {...this.state.pressability.getEventHandlers()} />\n *    );\n *\n * 3. Reset `Pressability` when your component unmounts.\n *\n *    componentWillUnmount() {\n *      this.state.pressability.reset();\n *    }\n *\n * ==================== Pressability Implementation Details ====================\n *\n * `Pressability` only assumes that there exists a `HitRect` node. The `PressRect`\n * is an abstract box that is extended beyond the `HitRect`.\n *\n * # Geometry\n *\n *  ┌────────────────────────┐\n *  │  ┌──────────────────┐  │ - Presses start anywhere within `HitRect`, which\n *  │  │  ┌────────────┐  │  │   is expanded via the prop `getHitSlop`.\n *  │  │  │ VisualRect │  │  │\n *  │  │  └────────────┘  │  │ - When pressed down for sufficient amount of time\n *  │  │    HitRect       │  │   before letting up, `VisualRect` activates for\n *  │  └──────────────────┘  │   as long as the press stays within `PressRect`.\n *  │       PressRect    o   │\n *  └────────────────────│───┘\n *          Out Region   └────── `PressRect`, which is expanded via the prop\n *                               `getPressRectOffset`, allows presses to move\n *                               beyond `HitRect` while maintaining activation\n *                               and being eligible for a \"press\".\n *\n * # State Machine\n *\n * ┌───────────────┐ ◀──── RESPONDER_RELEASE\n * │ NOT_RESPONDER │\n * └───┬───────────┘ ◀──── RESPONDER_TERMINATED\n *     │\n *     │ RESPONDER_GRANT (HitRect)\n *     │\n *     ▼\n * ┌─────────────────────┐          ┌───────────────────┐              ┌───────────────────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │  T + DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_IN            ├────────▶ │ PRESS_IN          ├────────────▶ │ LONG_PRESS_IN     │\n * └─┬───────────────────┘          └─┬─────────────────┘              └─┬─────────────────┘\n *   │           ▲                    │           ▲                      │           ▲\n *   │LEAVE_     │                    │LEAVE_     │                      │LEAVE_     │\n *   │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_              │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_                │PRESS_RECT │ENTER_\n *   │           │PRESS_RECT          │           │PRESS_RECT            │           │PRESS_RECT\n *   ▼           │                    ▼           │                      ▼           │\n * ┌─────────────┴───────┐          ┌─────────────┴─────┐              ┌─────────────┴─────┐\n * │ RESPONDER_INACTIVE_ │  DELAY   │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │              │ RESPONDER_ACTIVE_ │\n * │ PRESS_OUT           ├────────▶ │ PRESS_OUT         │              │ LONG_PRESS_OUT    │\n * └─────────────────────┘          └───────────────────┘              └───────────────────┘\n *\n * T + DELAY => LONG_PRESS_DELAY + DELAY\n *\n * Not drawn are the side effects of each transition.

(`runAfterInteractions` tasks are queued)\n * // later, on animation completion:\n * InteractionManager.clearInteractionHandle(handle);\n * // queued tasks run if all handles were cleared\n * ```\n *\n * `runAfterInteractions` takes either a plain callback function, or a\n * `PromiseTask` object with a `gen` method that returns a `Promise`.  If a\n * `PromiseTask` is supplied, then it is fully resolved (including asynchronous\n * dependencies that also schedule more tasks via `runAfterInteractions`) before\n * starting on the next task that might have been queued up synchronously\n * earlier.\n *\n * By default, queued tasks are executed together in a loop in one\n * `setImmediate` batch. If `setDeadline` is called with a positive number, then\n * tasks will only be executed until the deadline (in terms of js event loop run\n * time) approaches, at which point execution will yield via setTimeout,\n * allowing events such as touches to start interactions and block queued tasks\n * from executing, making apps more responsive.\n */\nconst InteractionManager = {\n  Events: keyMirror({\n    interactionStart: true,\n    interactionComplete: true,\n  }),\n\n  /**\n   * Schedule a function to run after all interactions have completed.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\nclass FlatList<ItemT> extends React.PureComponent<Props<ItemT>, void> {\n  static defaultProps: DefaultProps = defaultProps;\n  props: Props<ItemT>;\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

* with `ResponderEventPlugin`. Integrate with your platform specific scroll\n * views, or even your custom built (every-frame animating) scroll views so that\n * all of these systems play well with the `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * iOS scroll event timing nuances:\n * ===============================\n *\n *\n * Scrolling without bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... physical touch starts ...\n * 2. `onTouchStartCapture`   (when you press down to stop the scroll)\n * 3. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 4. `onResponderRelease`    (when lifting up - you could pause forever before * lifting)\n * 5. `onMomentumScrollEnd`\n *\n *\n * Scrolling with bouncing, if you touch down:\n * -------------------------------\n *\n * 1. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (when animation begins after letting up)\n *    ... bounce begins ...\n *    ... some time elapses ...\n *    ... physical touch during bounce ...\n * 2. `onMomentumScrollEnd`   (Makes no sense why this occurs first during bounce)\n * 3. `onTouchStartCapture`   (immediately after `onMomentumScrollEnd`)\n * 4. `onTouchStart`          (same, but bubble phase)\n * 5. `onTouchEnd`            (You could hold the touch start for a long time)\n * 6. `onMomentumScrollBegin` (When releasing the view starts bouncing back)\n *\n * So when we receive an `onTouchStart`, how can we tell if we are touching\n * *during* an animation (which then causes the animation to stop)? The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard. There are other reasons why the\n * keyboard could be dismissed.\n *\n *   this.props.onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Hide Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillHide\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidHide\n */\n\nconst IS_ANIMATING_TOUCH_START_THRESHOLD_MS = 16;\n\nexport type State = {|\n  isTouching: boolean,\n  lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: number,\n  lastMomentumScrollEndTime: number,\n  observedScrollSinceBecomingResponder: boolean,\n  becameResponderWhileAnimating: boolean,\n|};\n\nconst ScrollResponderMixin = {\n  _subscriptionKeyboardWillShow: (null: ?EmitterSubscription),\n  _subscriptionKeyboardWillHide: (null: ?EmitterSubscription),\n  _subscriptionKeyboardDidShow: (null: ?EmitterSubscription),\n  _subscriptionKeyboardDidHide: (null: ?EmitterSubscription),\n  scrollResponderMixinGetInitialState: function(): State {\n    return {\n      isTouching: false,\n      lastMomentumScrollBeginTime: 0,\n      lastMomentumScrollEndTime: 0,\n\n      // Reset to false every time becomes responder.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` or `id` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nclass VirtualizedList extends React.PureComponent<Props, State> {\n  props: Props;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  scrollToEnd(params?: ?{animated?: ?boolean, ...}) {\n    const animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    const veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n    const frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n    const offset = Math.max(\n      0,\n      frame.offset +\n        frame.length +\n        this._footerLength -\n        this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength,\n    );\n\n    if (this._scrollRef == null) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    this._scrollRef.scrollTo(\n      this.props.horizontal ? {x: offset, animated} : {y: offset, animated},\n    );\n  }\n\n  // scrollToIndex may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  scrollToIndex(params: {\n    animated?: ?boolean,\n    index: number,\n    viewOffset?: number,\n    viewPosition?: number,\n    ...\n  }) {\n    const {\n      data,\n      horizontal,\n      getItemCount,\n      getItemLayout,\n      onScrollToIndexFailed,\n    } = this.props;\n    const {animated, index, viewOffset, viewPosition} = params;\n    invariant(\n      index >= 0 && index < getItemCount(data),\n      `scrollToIndex out of range: requested index ${index} but maximum is ${getItemCount(\n        data,\n      ) - 1}`,\n    );\n    if (!getItemLayout && index > this._highestMeasuredFrameIndex) {\n      invariant(\n        !!onScrollToIndexFailed,\n        'scrollToIndex should be used in conjunction with getItemLayout or onScrollToIndexFailed, ' +\n          'otherwise there is no way to know the location of offscreen indices or handle failures.',\n      );\n      onScrollToIndexFailed({\n        averageItemLength: this._averageCellLength,\n        highestMeasuredFrameIndex: this._highestMeasuredFrameIndex,\n        index,\n      });\n      return;\n    }\n    const frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(index);\n    const offset =\n      Math.max(\n        0,\n        frame.offset -\n          (viewPosition || 0) *\n            (this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength - frame.length),\n      ) - (viewOffset || 0);\n\n    if (this._scrollRef == null) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    this._scrollRef.scrollTo(\n      horizontal ? {x: offset, animated} : {y: offset, animated},\n    );\n  }\n\n  // scrollToItem may be janky without getItemLayout prop.

This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nclass SectionList<SectionT: SectionBase<any>> extends React.PureComponent<\n  Props<SectionT>,\n  void,\n> {\n  props: Props<SectionT>;\n  static defaultProps: DefaultProps = defaultProps;\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the item at the specified `sectionIndex` and `itemIndex` (within the section)\n   * positioned in the viewable area such that `viewPosition` 0 places it at the top (and may be\n   * covered by a sticky header), 1 at the bottom, and 0.5 centered in the middle. `viewOffset` is a\n   * fixed number of pixels to offset the final target position, e.g. to compensate for sticky\n   * headers.\n   *\n   * Note: cannot scroll to locations outside the render window without specifying the\n   * `getItemLayout` prop.\n   */\n  scrollToLocation(params: ScrollToLocationParamsType) {\n    if (this._wrapperListRef != null) {\n      this._wrapperListRef.scrollToLocation(params);\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Tells the list an interaction has occurred, which should trigger viewability calculations, e.g.\n   * if `waitForInteractions` is true and the user has not scrolled.

The props will be merged in the order the `StatusBar` components were\n * mounted. One use case is to specify status bar styles per route using `Navigator`.\n *\n * ```\n *  <View>\n *    <StatusBar\n *      backgroundColor=\"blue\"\n *      barStyle=\"light-content\"\n *    />\n *    <Navigator\n *      initialRoute={{statusBarHidden: true}}\n *      renderScene={(route, navigator) =>\n *        <View>\n *          <StatusBar hidden={route.statusBarHidden} />\n *          ...\n *        </View>\n *      }\n *    />\n *  </View>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Imperative API\n *\n * For cases where using a component is not ideal, there are static methods\n * to manipulate the `StatusBar` display stack. These methods have the same\n * behavior as mounting and unmounting a `StatusBar` component.\n *\n * For example, you can call `StatusBar.pushStackEntry` to update the status bar\n * before launching a third-party native UI component, and then call\n * `StatusBar.popStackEntry` when completed.\n *\n * ```\n * const openThirdPartyBugReporter = async () => {\n *   // The bug reporter has a dark background, so we push a new status bar style.\n *   const stackEntry = StatusBar.pushStackEntry({barStyle: 'light-content'});\n *\n *   // `open` returns a promise that resolves when the UI is dismissed.\n *   await BugReporter.open();\n *\n *   // Don't forget to call `popStackEntry` when you're done.\n *   StatusBar.popStackEntry(stackEntry);\n * };\n * ```\n *\n * There is a legacy imperative API that enables you to manually update the\n * status bar styles. However, the legacy API does not update the internal\n * `StatusBar` display stack, which means that any changes will be overridden\n * whenever a `StatusBar` component is mounted or unmounted.\n *\n * It is strongly advised that you use `pushStackEntry`, `popStackEntry`, or\n * `replaceStackEntry` instead of the static methods beginning with `set`.\n *\n * ### Constants\n *\n * `currentHeight` (Android only) The height of the status bar.\n */\nclass StatusBar extends React.Component<Props> {\n  static _propsStack = [];\n\n  static _defaultProps = createStackEntry({\n    animated: false,\n    showHideTransition: 'fade',\n    backgroundColor:\n      Platform.OS === 'android'\n        ?

Props provide configurability for several features, such as\n * auto-correction, auto-capitalization, placeholder text, and different keyboard\n * types, such as a numeric keypad.\n *\n * The simplest use case is to plop down a `TextInput` and subscribe to the\n * `onChangeText` events to read the user input. There are also other events,\n * such as `onSubmitEditing` and `onFocus` that can be subscribed to. A simple\n * example:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = { text: 'Useless Placeholder' };\n *   }\n *\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         style={{height: 40, borderColor: 'gray', borderWidth: 1}}\n *         onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *         value={this.state.text}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip this line if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('AwesomeProject', () => UselessTextInput);\n * ```\n *\n * Two methods exposed via the native element are .focus() and .blur() that\n * will focus or blur the TextInput programmatically.\n *\n * Note that some props are only available with `multiline={true/false}`.\n * Additionally, border styles that apply to only one side of the element\n * (e.g., `borderBottomColor`, `borderLeftWidth`, etc.) will not be applied if\n * `multiline=false`. To achieve the same effect, you can wrap your `TextInput`\n * in a `View`:\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react';\n * import { AppRegistry, View, TextInput } from 'react-native';\n *\n * class UselessTextInput extends Component {\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *       <TextInput\n *         {...this.props} // Inherit any props passed to it; e.g., multiline, numberOfLines below\n *         editable = {true}\n *         maxLength = {40}\n *       />\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * export default class UselessTextInputMultiline extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props);\n *     this.state = {\n *       text: 'Useless Multiline Placeholder',\n *     };\n *   }\n *\n *   // If you type something in the text box that is a color, the background will change to that\n *   // color.\n *   render() {\n *     return (\n *      <View style={{\n *        backgroundColor: this.state.text,\n *        borderBottomColor: '#000000',\n *        borderBottomWidth: 1 }}\n *      >\n *        <UselessTextInput\n *          multiline = {true}\n *          numberOfLines = {4}\n *          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}\n *          value={this.state.text}\n *        />\n *      </View>\n *     );\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // skip these lines if using Create React Native App\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent(\n *  'AwesomeProject',\n *  () => UselessTextInputMultiline\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * `TextInput` has by default a border at the bottom of its view.

I'm sorry for this.\n\n        This is a hack. Ideally we would forwardRef to the underlying\n        host component. However, since TextInput has it's own methods that can be\n        called as well, if we used the standard forwardRef then these\n        methods wouldn't be accessible and thus be a breaking change.\n\n        We have a couple of options of how to handle this:\n        - Return a new ref with everything we methods from both. This is problematic\n          because we need React to also know it is a host component which requires\n          internals of the class implementation of the ref.\n        - Break the API and have some other way to call one set of the methods or\n          the other. This is our long term approach as we want to eventually\n          get the methods on host components off the ref. So instead of calling\n          ref.measure() you might call ReactNative.measure(ref). This would hopefully\n          let the ref for TextInput then have the methods like `.clear`. Or we do it\n          the other way and make it TextInput.clear(textInputRef) which would be fine\n          too. Either way though is a breaking change that is longer term.\n        - Mutate this ref. :( Gross, but accomplishes what we need in the meantime\n          before we can get to the long term breaking change.\n        */\n      if (ref) {\n        ref.clear = clear;\n        ref.isFocused = isFocused;\n        ref.getNativeRef = getNativeRef;\n      }\n    },\n  });\n\n  const _onPress = (event: PressEvent) => {\n    if (props.editable || props.editable === undefined) {\n      nullthrows(inputRef.current).focus();\n    }\n  };\n\n  const _onChange = (event: ChangeEvent) => {\n    // Make sure to fire the mostRecentEventCount first so it is already set on\n    // native when the text value is set.\n    if (inputRef.current) {\n      inputRef.current.setNativeProps({\n        mostRecentEventCount: event.nativeEvent.eventCount,\n      });\n    }\n\n    const text = event.nativeEvent.text;\n    props.onChange && props.onChange(event);\n    props.onChangeText && props.onChangeText(text);\n\n    if (!inputRef.current) {\n      // calling `props.onChange` or `props.onChangeText`\n      // may clean up the input itself.

If a palm is\n   *   accidentally counted as a touch, but a finger is moving greatly, the palm\n   *   will move slightly, but we only want to count the single moving touch.\n   * - x0/y0: Centroid location (non-cumulative) at the time of becoming\n   *   responder.\n   * - dx/dy: Cumulative touch distance - not the same thing as sum of each touch\n   *   distance. Accounts for touch moves that are clustered together in time,\n   *   moving the same direction.

Therefore, `PanResponder` does not call\n   * `onResponderMove` passed the first dispatch.
